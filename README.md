Dense Prime Cluster Miner for Coinshield CPU Channel.

No longer useful for Mainnet Mining, consider using only for Testnet and Private Nexus Networks.

Commandline Arguments are IP PORT THREADS TIMEOUT. IP and PORT are required, THREADS default is CPU Cores, TIMEOUT default is 10 seconds.
This miner was created by me - from scratch - and Optimized by Supercomuting, further modified by Kencorma. 
Meter shows PPS for Primes per Second and CPS for Chains per Second [Above Difficulty 3.x]
